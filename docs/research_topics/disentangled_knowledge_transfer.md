# Disentangled and Entangled Knowledge Transfer

To study the transfer of a specific type of knowledge about objects, spatial relationship or task goals, please run on the ```libero_object```, ```libero_spatial```, and ```libero_goal``` benchmarks respectively.

To study the transfer of entangled knowledge, please consider ```libero_10```. The detailed instructions to run a specific network with a specific algorithm are provided in other sections.
