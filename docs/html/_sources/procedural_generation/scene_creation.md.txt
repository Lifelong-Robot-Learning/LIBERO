Problem class defines a domain. A domain is something you will define initial state distributions and task goals on top of it. All the problem definitions in the LIBERO is located in `libero/libero/envs/problems`. We also provide a [template](templates/problem_class_template.py) that make it easy for users to create their own problem class.
